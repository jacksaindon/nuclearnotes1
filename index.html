<h2> Nuclear Notes (Fusion vs Fission, Nuclear Power Plants)</h2>

<h3> Miscellanious </h3>
</center>
<p class="indent">
-Nuclear power was about 20% of the U.S. Electricity Generation in 2017.
<br><br>
-Most Uranium ore is mined in open pit or underground mines. The uranium content of the ore is often between only 0.1% and 0.2%. Therefore, large amounts of ore have to be mined to get at the Uranium.
<br><br>
-Natural Uranium is composed of 0.72% U-235 and about 99.27% U-238. The element U-235 is the primary isotope for nuclear power plants.
<br><br>
-Uranium ore for Nuclear power plants must be enriched. Normally, the amount of the U-235 is enriched from 0.7% of the uranium mass to about 2-3%.
<br><br>
-Although it takes a lot of ore to get a small amount of usable Uranium, Uranium also contains a higher energy content, making those small amounts power much more than larger amounts of coal and natural gas.
<br><br>
-Weapons grade Uranium is enriched to 90% U-235, making it very difficult to make nuclear bombs.

<h3>Fusion</h3>
</center>
<p class="indent">
-2 Lighter nuclei combine at extreme temperature to form heavier nuclei and release energy. (E = mc^2)
<br><br>
-It's significantly more difficult to crease fusion reactions on Earth because you can't easily contain the fusion reaction. (Super hot.)
<br><br>
-If you can create a magnetic force that could contain a 10million degree fusion reaction and keep that heat contained (like gravity does on the sun) a fusion reaction would work, however to power the magnets it uses more energy than the reaction is producing, making it non-profitable.
<br><br>
</p>

<h3>Fission</h3>
</center>
<p class="indent">
-Neutron fires at target nucleus, splits into two atoms and 3 more neutrons, which go on to splitting other nuclei.
<br><br>
-If left unchecked, it can cause a nuclear meltdown.
<br><br>
-Safety at a nuclear power plant (5 years ago)
<br>
-Guardhouse where you must present a picture ID.
<br>
-Explosive detectors
<br>
-Metal detectors
<br>
-Etc...
<br><br>
&nbsp -What are control rods?
<br>
-If you put them all the way down into the reactor they will stop the reaction.
<br>
-They are used to absorb neutrons so that the reaction does not go uncontrolled.
<br>
-Do not pull them all the way out of the reactor core.
<br>
-Without control rods there would be a nuclear chain reaction.
<br><br>
-Nuclear fission creates heat to create steam that drives a large turbine to create energy.
<br><br><br>

<h3> Nuclear Plants </h3>
</center>

<p class="indent">

-Chernobyl was caused by a technician who completely removed the control rods, resulting in a chain reaction and a meltdown of the reactor.
<br><br>
-New types of fuel may eliminate a possible meltdown. They want to use a pebble bed reactor. (Individual pebbles will never get hot enough to meltdown, but all together they can boil the water to power the reactor)
<br><br>
-In Minnesota we have Monticello Nuclear Power Plant and Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant.
<br><br>
&nbsp -Advantages of nuclear stuff.
<br>
-Pollution free (not including waste.)
<br>
-Can reduce our dependence on foreign energy.
<br>
-Uses less fuel. Transporation of fuel is 80% cheaper.
<br><br>
&nbsp -Disadvantages
<br>
-Mining takes a lot.
<br>
-Spent fuel from nuclear power plants is radioactive for centuries and it is difficult to store.
<br><br>
-Most radioactive waste is stored on site in pools of water until they cool down, and then they go to casks.
